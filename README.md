## Background and Considerations

I have chosen to write these from scratch at this time for simplicity, and the limited support for Ansible on Windows without also having a Linux host nearby. I will continue to look into other options, but for now, this should meet my needs.

## Limitations

Currently, these scripts do not fully handle everything I would like, such as system bootstrapping and early configuration.

## Help

Questions and comments are always welcome, please open an issue.
